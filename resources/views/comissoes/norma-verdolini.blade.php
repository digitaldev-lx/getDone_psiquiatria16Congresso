                    <h4>ITALY</h4>
                    <p>Motivated by a special interest in mental health and behavioral conditions, I decided to study the Degree of Medicine at the University of Perugia (Italy) with the objective to acquire an extensive knowledge in mental and physical health.
                        After graduating in 2011, I performed the clinical residency training in Psychiatry at the Division of Psychiatry, Clinical Psychology and Rehabilitation of the Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital in Perugia (Italy).
                        In 2014 I performed a research attachment at the South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust in collaboration with the University of Cambridge, Clare College, UK and in September 2015 I have been named a Research Fellow of the Bedfordshire Centre for Mental Health Research in association with the University of Cambridge (BCMHR-CU).<br><br>
                        In the last year of the specialty in Italy I created a collaboration with the Bipolar and Depressive Disorders Unit of the Hospital Clínic in Barcelona and I got intimately involved in a project that aimed to understand the psychiatric correlates of self- or hetero-aggression in bipolar disorder that became the focus of my PhD.<br><br>
                        In January 2018 I started a pre-doctoral contract at FIDMAG Hermanas Hospitalarias Research Foundation (Spain) and developed research focused on neuroimaging in bipolar disorder.<br><br>
                        The 29th of November, 2018 I defended my PhD thesis entitled "SELF- AND HETERO-AGGRESSION: Clinical Implications in Bipolar Disorder and Mixed States".<br><br>
                        In May 2019 I became a fellow of the "Biomedicine international training research programme for excellent clinician-scientists-BITRECS" project at Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer-IDIBAPS, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 754550. My research line was focused on early stages in bipolar disorders, under the tutorship of Prof. Eduard Vieta. I conducted a 3-year longitudinal study focused on first episodes of mania and psychosis with the aim to identify specific prodromes of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as well as the clinical, neural, and cognitive predictors of worse clinical course.<br><br>
                        In January 2022 I returned back to Italy to work as a clinical psychiatrist and a post-doctoral researcher in the Community Mental Health Service of Perugia, in the effort to reconcile my career with personal life. </p>
